# ESP8266-Tutorial
Interactive code snippets designed to highlight the ESP8266's capabilities

### How it works
1. You connect the ESP8266 to the OLED display.
2. You edit a code snippet in Lua provided for controlling an OLED display so that it can take text input and display it on the OLED.
3. You write code in HTML for the web server that is hosted: this code will take a user's input through a form field.
4. You edit a code snippet in Lua that brings together the above two files to host a web server that takes a user's input and displays it on an OLED display.


### To Do
1. Create code snippets for controlling the OLED display and hosting the web server.
2. Create slides explaining the relevant syntax and concepts.
3. Test all ESPs and OLED displays to make sure they work and connect
4. Bundle necessary drivers, code snippets, and ESPlorer in a download file.
5. Test this on someone (CS Prof? Other student?)
